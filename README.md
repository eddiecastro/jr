# SalesLoft UI Exercise

## Instructions
Create a fluid & responsive page layout using HTML, SCSS, and JS that is based on the wireframe provided.  This is a real-world page in SalesLoft’s product.  

The stylistic design is purposefully open ended - it is up to you.  We’d like to go for clean and modern styling.  You should also refer to the Styleguide and the “Actual Page” for design hints as to our colors, general styles, etc.  

The functionality of components on the page should be as complete as possible without interacting with a backend data service.
