# SalesLoft UI Exercise

## Instructions
Create a fluid & responsive page layout using HTML, SCSS, and JS that is based on the wireframe provided.  This is a real-world page in SalesLoft’s product.  Feel free to explore responsive concepts for the table and menu as well as sorting, pagination etc.

The rough wireframe is purposefully open ended - it is up to you.  We’d like to go for clean and modern styling that is consistent with the rest of our application.  You can also refer to the Style Guide for design hints as to our colors, general styles, etc.  

The functionality of components on the page should be as complete as possible without interacting with a backend data service.
