# SalesLoft UI Exercise

## Instructions

Create a fluid & responsive page layout using HTML, SCSS, and JS that is based on the Gmail's web interface. Make any improvements to the UX that you see fit. This is intended to show your knowledge of CSS3, HTML, Sass/Less, and Javascript (vanilla or framework of your choice), while also showing a grasp of best UI/UX practices.

This application should meet the following basic requirements:

  * Uses color scheme similar to that of Gmail
  * Displays a list of emails with name, title, date and tags
  * Allows for selection of one or more emails by the end user
  * Allows users to perform a number of actions on one more more selected emails
  * Shows a sidebar that shows a number of folders and tags
  * Options to display the tabular data in different ways (this is intentionally vague, would like to see you explore different ways to represent the data)
  * Table cells should be viewable at all resolutions above 320px

Spend time on both the UI/UX and the actual functionality of the list view. This view should be as complete as possible without interacting with a backend data service, so look at stubbing out fake data. Try to time box this exercise to take no longer than 4 hours. We will work to expand or change this exercise during your on-site interview.

## Submission

Please clone this repo and submit via email to daniel.andrews@salesloft.com

## Result should include

  * HTML5 output file
